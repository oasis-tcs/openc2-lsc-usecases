## 3-Google Contributions to PoC

Google has provided $60k of credits for GCP service in support of OpenC2. Participate in the plugfest and learn how to take advantage of this.

Google supports https://redteamproject.org/ and will use the Red Team Project Cyber Range projects (see https://github.com/redteam-project/cyber-range-scenarios and https://github.com/orgs/redteam-project/projects/1) to drive exploit playbooks.

Other open source software as needed - TBD.
